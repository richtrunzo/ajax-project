Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to gain experience pulling data and working with an external API and AJAX methodology, which is why most of the core features are based on utilizing outside data. Through building this I was able to gain a lot of experience in working with AJAX methodology and figuring out the best ways to utilize an external API based on the data recieved within various xhr responses.
